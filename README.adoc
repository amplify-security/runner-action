= Amplify Runner Action

Github Action to run https://amplify.security[Amplify Security]'s scanner orchestrator.

This action launches a container within your workflow that will authenticate with Amplify's public API, execute code scanners against your changes, and submit scan results to Amplify for generating remediations.

== Usage

For most users, you'll setup this action via the onboarding process when https://app.amplify.security/[signing up at Amplify].
You can however introduce this to existing workflows.
A minimal (incomplete) config with the necessary YAML is provided below.
